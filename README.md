Qingnang Smart Diagnosis is an **end-to-end AI healthcare framework** with **field-proven application capabilities**, designed to provide efficient and intelligent solutions for the medical industry. By integrating advanced large language model (LLM) technologies, this framework has realized core functions including intelligent triage, patient registration, medical record creation, diagnosis, ordering lab tests, prescriptions, and treatment plan development. We are dedicated to enhancing healthcare efficiency, improving patient experiences, and driving intelligent transformation in the medical industry.
With a focus on ease of use and adaptability, this framework supports seamless integration via APIs with leading LLMs such as DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama, and Baichuan. Whether deployed in cloud-based or on-premises environments, it enables rapid construction of **intelligent, healthcare-centric service systems**.

**Core Features**
+ End-to-End Interface: Supports HTTP service interfaces for pre-consultation, in-consultation, and post-consultation processes.
+ Flexible Data Integration: Enables customization of user-specific databases (e.g., drugs, disease names) and enhances implementation effectiveness through LLM + retrieval.
+ High-Compatibility Deployment: Allows direct access to various models via OpenAI services.
+ Multi-Scenario Adaptability: Covers diverse application scenarios such as hospitals, telemedicine, and pharmaceutical distribution.
+ Multi-Role Support: Offers comprehensive functionality for medical staff, patients, and administrators, streamlining workflows for all parties.

**Technical Advantages**
+ Agent Capabilities: Features meticulously optimized prompt instructions and reasoning workflow orchestration.
+ Key Challenge Solutions: Provides all solutions combining large model intent recognition, intent fallback, SQL distribution interfaces, and multi-channel retrieval.

##  4. Quick Start


**4.1  Environment Configuration**

We recommend the following Docker/Conda environment configurations:
+ Ubuntu20.04„ÄÅpython3.12
+ NVIDIA-SMI 535.154.05„ÄÅDriver Version: 535.154.05„ÄÅCUDA Version: 12.2

You can use your own environment that meets the requirements, or launch a container via the following commands:

```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04
